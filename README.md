# TharKayTa-Township-Yangon-Myanmar-May2019_ElectricityAnalysiDataCollection-Preparationand-Visualize
Myanmar is facing high energy demand. More than 70 % of electricity is from hydro power. So in summer, the less of water flow into dam causes problems. That would be the reason that the government have to cut off electricity. Especially it is a big issues for Yangon City because of too much population and hot weather. In Yangon, there are 45 townships. I pick just one township from Yangon Region. This mini project is a kind of data analysis about TharKayTa Township, Yangon ,Myanmar. The objective is to analysis the  time of electricity off in TharKayTa Towhship for three Zones. By visualization, we can see clearly the hours of electricity off in each day and in one month of May for three Zones in TharKayTa Township. And can provide the schedule that when will electricity off. And which feder have to use so much and is there energy balance in the zone. I use pandas for exploring data and numpy for process execution and matplotlib and seborn for visualization. The step are
(1) Data Collection 
(2) Cleaning and Transforming 
(3) Analysis 
(4) Visualization for the local people and decision makers.
